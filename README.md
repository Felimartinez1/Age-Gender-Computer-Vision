# Age and Gender Estimation using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based age and gender estimation system. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the age and gender of individuals from facial images. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of facial images, allowing it to make accurate predictions across different age groups and gender categories.

## Project Overview

- **Data Augmentation**: We applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different facial expressions, poses, and lighting conditions.

- **Gender Prediction**: The model predicts the gender of the individual in the input image, classifying them as either male or female.

- **Age Estimation**: The model estimates the age of the person in the image, providing an approximate age range.

- **Usage**: You can easily use this age and gender estimation system by providing a facial image as input. The system will return the predicted gender and age range.
